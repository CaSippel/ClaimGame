# ClaimGame
### OBJECTIVE
To claim (run over) randomly generated territory to create obstacles for their opponent.

### HOW TO PLAY
When a piece of territory (white square) is generated, run over it to change its colour to match yours.
You can run over blocks of your own colour.
If you run over a block that is the other player's colour, you automatically lose the game.
Upon hitting the edges of the border, you lose.
